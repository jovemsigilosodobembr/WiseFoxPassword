# [ cupp.cfg ]
#
# This is configuration file for cupp.py
#

# There are no options to configure the application within it. The app reads it,
# does not change it. I'm hoping you'll figure out how to looking at this.

# [ 1337 mode ]
# If you think this default settings are not right,
# you can change it for yourself. For example if you
# don't like a=4, just change it to a=@ :)
# If you don't need some chars, just comment it! Duplicates are allowed too.
# For adding chars, you might need to add some lines in cupp.py...
